## Task: Fix handling of special character ] in task parsing

### Problem
The `mark_task_complete_markdown()` function in `ralphy.sh` (line 557) had a bug in its regex for escaping special characters. The character class `[[\.*^$/]` was meant to escape sed BRE special characters, but it failed to properly include `]`.

In POSIX sed character classes, `]` terminates the class. The pattern `[[\.*^$/]` was matching `[`, `.`, `*`, `^`, `$`, `/` but NOT `]` because the `]` at the end was interpreted as closing the class, not as a character to match.

### Impact
When a task name contained `]` (like "Fix handling of special character ] in task parsing"), the `mark_task_complete_markdown()` function would:
1. Fail to escape the `]` in the task name
2. Generate a malformed sed command
3. Fail to mark the task complete in PRD.md
4. Cause the loop to potentially retry the same task infinitely

### Fix
Changed line 557 in `ralphy.sh` from:
```bash
escaped_task=$(printf '%s\n' "$task" | sed 's/[[\.*^$/]/\\&/g')
```
to:
```bash
escaped_task=$(printf '%s\n' "$task" | sed 's/[][\.*^$/]/\\&/g')
```

The fix places `]` first in the character class (`[][\.*^$/]`), which is the POSIX-compliant way to include a literal `]` in a bracket expression.

### Tests Added
Created `tests/special-chars.bats` with 10 test cases covering:
- Individual special character escaping ([ ] . * ^ $ /)
- Multiple special characters combined
- Verification that the code uses the correct pattern

### Verification
- All 92 tests pass (including 10 new tests for special character handling)
