2026-01-18: Bumped VERSION from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 on line 15 of ralphy.sh. Added BATS test suite in tests/version.bats to verify version variable and --version flag output. Tests pass. Linting passes.
2026-01-18: Added 10-minute timeout (AI_TIMEOUT=600) to AI commands. Added get_timeout_cmd() helper for cross-platform support (timeout on Linux, gtimeout on macOS). Wrapped all AI engine commands in run_ai_command() and run_parallel_agent() with timeout. Added --timeout N flag to override default. Added BATS tests in tests/timeout.bats. Tests pass. Linting passes (no errors).
2026-01-18: Fixed ShellCheck SC2086 on line 708 (formerly 702). Changed unquoted `$draft_flag` to safe parameter expansion `${draft_flag:+"$draft_flag"}` in gh pr create command. Added BATS tests in tests/shellcheck-fixes.bats to verify the fix. Tests pass. Linting passes (SC2086 resolved, other warnings are pre-existing).
2026-01-18: Marked --timeout N flag task as complete in PRD.md. Implementation was already done (line 244-247 parse_args, tests in tests/timeout.bats). Tests pass. Linting passes.
2026-01-18: Implemented agent-specific progress files for parallel mode. Changed run_parallel_agent() to create progress-agent-$agent_num.txt instead of shared progress.txt. Added merge_agent_progress_files() function to merge all agent files after parallel execution completes. Added BATS tests in tests/parallel-progress.bats (8 tests). Tests pass (17 total). Linting passes (no new errors).
